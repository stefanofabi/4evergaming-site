4evergaming is characterized by offering a service with zero knowledge required. Their service caters to those new to game server hosting by offering pre-built configurations, which can be activated with just one click.

## Site thinking :thinking:
I designed the 4evergaming pages with the dynamic loading of the site in mind to demonstrate how fast the servers and how easy it is for the user to understand the content so that they can choose their best option without requiring human intervention.

Everything is combined with the company's main color palette of red and black. The red color gives a feeling of attraction, of more attention and greater power. In turn, the black color could not be missing in the gaming sector since it provides exclusivity and is also related to the night, where people spend their time playing online.

To give a visual balance as an alternative palette I chose white and gray. White served to not give a feeling of authoritarianism, I want to give a good appearance on the internet to generate trust with users and not be afraid to make their purchase. With gray I show maturity by providing information that is useful to users and that they believe in me.

## Scope :earth_americas:
Internet is a very big world. The business is focused on Argentina, but it is planned to expand to Latin American countries such as Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, etc. in the future. The site will have its default language, which will be Spanish, and will have its corresponding translations into Portuguese and American English as a universal language for visitors of other languages.

## Optimization :rocket:
The texts are written for better positioning against search engines, with keywords such as 4evergaming, Argentina, game servers, game hosting, vps gaming, counter-strike, minecraft, grand theft auto, fps, tickrate, rcon, pcw, mix, competitive servers, rates, latency, loss, choke, var, tcadmin, among other words.

The site is linked with CloudFlare to provide fast loading of javascript resources, images, css, etc. Certain parts of the site are lazy loaded so that the user gets to the main content as quickly as possible.

## Legal issues :necktie:
For legal reasons in Argentina, a QR form must be displayed on all e-commerce sites that allows the company's fiscal data to be displayed.

By another law, a repentance button must be displayed so that the buyer can easily revoke their purchase. It must be an easy and direct access link from the home page of the Internet site and must be in a prominent and visible place.

## Security :shield:
The site is developed under the Laravel framework for PHP. The framework offers a "secure" way of dealing with sensitive application information such as access keys, authentication keys, among others.

The website has a small public API to check if the servers are online or not, check server information such as server name, number of connected players, current map, etc. This API is protected under a certain acceptable threshold of requests, otherwise it blocks the user from making these requests for a short period of time.
